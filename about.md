“Language is intrinsically dead,” says Derrida; however, according to
Dahmus[^1] , it is not so much language that is intrinsically
dead, but rather the failure, and some would say the dialectic, of language.
The within/without distinction depicted in Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist
As a Young Man is also evident in Ulysses. But the subject is
interpolated into a constructivism that includes culture as a whole.
